## 🌟 Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, modern GUI that guides you through each step of the ML process.
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare your data effortlessly.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate dynamic plots to explore your data, including histograms, scatter plots, and more.
- **Wide Range of Models**: Supports supervised (Classification, Regression) and unsupervised (Clustering) algorithms like KMeans, DBSCAN, Random Forest, and more.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Select features, configure model parameters, and evaluate results with ease.
- **Responsive Design**: Scrollable sidebar and dynamic result panels to handle large datasets and multiple models.

> This project is a testament to thoughtful design and robust functionality, making it an excellent tool for anyone looking to dive into machine learning or showcase their skills in a professional setting.
